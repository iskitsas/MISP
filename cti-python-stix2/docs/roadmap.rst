Development Roadmap
===================

.. warning::

    Prior to version 1.0, all APIs are considered unstable and subject to
    change.

This is a list of (planned) features before version 1.0 is released.

* Serialization of all STIX and Cyber Observable objects to JSON.
* De-serialization (parsing) of all STIX and Cyber Observable objects.
* APIs for versioning (revising and revoking) STIX objects.
* APIs for marking STIX objects and interpreting markings of STIX objects.
* :ref:`datastore_api`, providing a common interface for querying sources
  of STIX content (such as objects in memory, on a filesystem, in a database, or
  via a TAXII feed).
