<h2>General Layout</h2>
<h3>The top bar</h3>
	<p><img src="<?php echo $baseurl;?>/img/doc/menu_image.png" alt = "" title = "This is the main menu that will be accessible from all of the views. In some instances, some additional buttons that will appear on top of these when a view provides it."/></p>
	<p>This menu contains all of the main functions of the site as a series of dropdown menues. These contains all (from the current user's perspective) accessible functions sorted into several groups.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Home button:</b> This button will return you to the start screen of the application, which is the event index page (more about this later).</li>
		<li><b>Event Actions:</b> All the malware data entered into MISP is made up of an event object that is described by its connected attributes. The Event actions menu gives access to all the functionality that has to do with the creation, modification, deletion, publishing, searching and listing of events and attributes.</li>
		<li><b>Input Filters:</b> Input filters alter what and how data can be entered into this instance. Apart from the basic validation of attribute entry by type, it is possible for the site administrators to define regular expression replacements and blacklists for certain values in addition to blocking certain values from being exportable. Users can view these replacement and blacklist rules here whilst administrator can alter them.</li>
		<li><b>Global Actions:</b> This menu gives you access to information about MISP and this instance. You can view and edit your own profile, view the manual, read the news or the terms of use again, see a list of the active organisations on this instance and a histogram of their contributions by attribute type.</li>
		<li><b>Sync Actions:</b> With administrator access rights, shows a list of the connected instances and allows the initiation of a push and a pull (more about the synchronisation mechanisms later).</li>
		<li><b>Administration:</b> Administrators can add, edit or remove user accounts and user roles. Roles define the access rights to certain features such as publishing of events, usage of the REST interface or synchronisation of any user belonging to the given role. Site administrators can also access a contact form, through which it is possible to reset the passwords of users, or to just get in touch with them via encrypted e-mails.</li>
		<li><b>Audit:</b> If you have audit permissions, you can view the logs for your organisation (or for site admins for the entire system) here or even search the logs if you are interested in something specific.</li>
		<li><b>Discussions:</b> Link to the discussion threads.</li>
		<li><b>Proposal Notifications: </b> This shows how many proposals your organisation has received and across how many events they are spread out. Clicking this will take you to the list of proposals.</li>
		<li><b>Log out:</b> Logs you out of the system.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>A list of the contents of each of the above drop-down menues</h3>
